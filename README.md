- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Stine!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making tools for others to use via backend technologies.
- âœ¨ My background is in computer programming, data analytics and quantitative research; My particular passion is making interfaces to data or tools which challenge me to think about how to write code that is both user-centered and as efficient as possible.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about optimal API design, as well as continuing to build on my knowledge of data engineering tools, such as Apache Spark, Kafka, and Airflow.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at kstine93@gmail.com or [find me on LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/kevinstinedata).
